Hello ðŸ‘‹ .I'm Trixie Murugi

I'm currently working on a Portfolio Landing page project

The project aim is basically to be able to create your own Portfolio Landing page using HTML and CSS to style your page, bootstrap could also be used in the styling of the page.

Project setup instructons include ; First having HTML with installments of necessary Extensions which aid in enhancing your code. Link CSS to HTML and also Bootstrap if one chooses to use that for styling. An image is required so one should download an image and link to the HTML and CSS. Create a github account and create a repository where we link the local repo to the remote repo. gh pages branch is neccesary inorder to enable one to link to live sites. With that your good to go.
